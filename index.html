          <h2>Moira Smith
          </h2>
          <img src="./images/smithmoira.jpg">
        </div>
        I was one of the last people to see Police Officer
        Moira Smith before she perished in the collapse of the World Trade Center.
        I remember her very vividly because my experience was personal, intense, and
        unique. This is to document what she was doing in those final minutes.
      </p>

      <p>I have to background this story by saying that my wife has been a flight attendant
        for a major US Airline for over twenty years. During that time, she has received
        extensive training in emergency evacuation procedures. I have seen her practice
        the drill for evacuating passengers from a fiery aircraft on many occasions.
        I always felt that she was very sincere about executing her responsibility
        in such a situation. Her rehearsals includeded details that would never occur
        to the average person. For example, she was trained to touch a door with the
        back of her hand before opening it. If the door was so hot that it burned her
        hand, she would still be able to use the front of her hand to hold a rope should

        that be necessary. The dedication and intensity with which she executed these
        exercises left me no doubt about her intention to perform in an emergency situation. </p>

      <p>On 9/11, I entered 2 WTC moments before the first tower was struck. I took
        the express elevator to the 78th floor sky lobby and everything appeared normal.
        I entered the local elevator and pressed 84. The elevator stopped on the 82nd
        floor and a young man leapt into the car just as the door was closing. He was
        screaming, &quot;Terrorists, go down&quot; I asked him what he had seen, but
        he was in such a state of shock he couldn't communicate. He was crouched in
        the corner and kept saying, &quot;Fire! Fire&quot; </p>

      <p>The elevator continued up to my floor but I didn't get out. I kept trying
        to find out what the young man had seen. When we got back down to the sky lobby,
        the scene has changed completely. The floor was packed, and people were lined
        up ten deep in front of the express elevators to go back down. We weren't sure
        if the elevators were going to be running, so many of us started down the stairs. </p>

      <p>At first, it was a slow march. There were people streaming into the descending
        crowd on every floor. However, when we had gone down about ten floors, the
        flow of people joining us stopped. I though that perhaps the situation had
        clarified, and I decided to view the scene for myself. </p>

      <p>The first reentry door was on the sixtieth floor. I asked a fellow who was
        walking around locking up offices where I could go to see the North Tower.
        He pointed down a hallway and said, &quot;It's that way, but don't look. It's
        too horrible!&quot; </p>

      <p>I went anyway. When I got to the window, I looked up and saw the flames shooting
        out of the top floors. I looked down and saw three distinct large pools of
        blood. I reckon the largest was thirty yards across. The bodies were mixed
        in with the wreckage and I could make out several legs sticking out of the
        debris. I looked back up just to see a man in a white shirt jumping from a
        top floor. I saw his face clearly. My eyes followed him down till the ground
        came into focus, then I looked away. </p>

      <p>My reaction was very physical and intense. My stomach turned, my knees became
        wobbly, and my eyes saw black. I almost passed out. </p>

      <p>I thought that by exiting the building under these circumstances I would add
        to the confusion and impede the rescue workers. I decided to sit down and wait
        for the emergency to get under control. I had been sitting for about 15 minutes,
        when the second plane hit our building. We knew something enormous had happened
        because the building shook and the temperature rose by ten degrees in an instant. </p>

      <p>There were about ten of us who had been sitting around in the reception area
        on that floor. We all got up quickly and hurried down the steps. The staircase
        was open now and we were moving quite fast. </p>

      <p>After we had gone down several floors, we came to a cripple woman lying on
        a landing between floors. Her walking cane was by her side and she was looking
        at the people hurrying by. She was yelling, &quot;I'm going to die. I'm going
        to die.&quot; I felt a pang of guilt as I continued past her with the rest
        of the crowd. My mind flashed images of my wife alone in the bed and my sons
        without a father. Nothing else mattered, I had to get out. </p>

      <p>When we got down to about the fifth floor, we caught up with the tail end
        of the main crowd. The trek down the steps became a slow march again. I looked
        back to see who was behind us. There I saw an Oriental fellow carrying the
        crippled woman on his back. </p>

      <p>I didn't fault myself for being a coward. Rather, I admired him for being
        calm and composed in this emergency situation. I thought, I could have done
        that too - or at least I could have helped out - but I'm not thinking I'm
        panicked&quot;. As we stood there in the dimly lit staircase, I was thinking
        about the carnage I would witness when we came out into the plaza lobby. I
        was trying to brace myself. To be prepared for the worst. </p>

      <p>We exited the stairwell to a ramp which led toward the main plaza. A slow
        moving line progressed along the ramp to a down escalator which connected to
        the underground passageway being used to exit the compound. Moira stood at
        the end of the ramp directing the traffic down the escalator. She had her flashlight
        in her right hand and she was waving it like a baton. She was repeating over
        and over- &quot;Don't look! Keep Moving.&quot; </p>
      <p>I immediately had the sensation that I knew what had happened there before.
        I thought: groups of people had come through here and stopped to look at the
        horror of the situation. There mass hysteria and the exit paths were blocked.
        She broke it up and got things moving again. Now she's making sure it doesn't
        happen again. </p>
      <p>It was a very intense personal experience for me. It was like I was in a scene
        that I had witnessed before only this time - instead of my wife rescuing strangers
        - it was me being rescued by Moira. </p>
      <p>I came to the end of the ramp and I was standing squarely in front of Moira,
        I leaned to the left to try look past her to see the plaza. She quickly matched
        my motion and blocked my vision saying &quot;don't look.&quot; Our eyes made
        direct contact. My eyes said to her, &quot;I know how bad it is and I understand
        what you're doing.&quot; Her face was full of pain and her eyes said to me, &quot;In
        this horrific situation, this is the best and only thing I can do. </p>
      <p>The mass of people exiting the building felt the calm assurance that they
        were being directed by someone in authority who was in control of the situation.
        Her actions even seemed ordinary, even commonplace. She insulated the evacuees
        from the awareness of the dangerous situation they were in, with the result
        that everything preceded smoothly. </p>

      <p>In my company - sixty one people perished - one hundred eighty survived. Afterwards,
        I asked several of my fellow employees if they had noticed the woman police
        officer at the escalator landing. They said, &quot;Yeah - she was directing
        traffic.&quot; </p>
      <p>A statue of Moira holding her flashlight while evacuating the building -
        would be an excellent way to pay tribute to the heroism of the NYPD on 9/11.
        As a work of art, it would work on many levels. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It commemorates the Supreme Sacrifice in an understated way that
          will encourage viewers to look twice. </li>
        <li>It will have special meaning for women. Moira's job on 9/11 was
          without heraldry, yet she may have been responsible for saving more lives than
          anyone else.</li>
        <li>Directing traffic is an everyday event in the life of a police officer. While Moira's heroic action was
          compressed into a few short hours, there is a direct parallel with
          the Covid-19 Essential Workers. In both instances, they performed commonplace actions in the face of
          personal danger. The statue will resonate with healthcare workers, the uniformed services and
          supermarket checkout clerks.
